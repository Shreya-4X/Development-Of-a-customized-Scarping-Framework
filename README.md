The *Customized Scraping Framework* is a web-based application built with Flask that enables users to scrape, analyze, and visualize web data. Users start by entering a URL, which the app processes and displays using Flask and BeautifulSoup. They can select HTML tags of interest, and the app extracts the relevant data, presenting it on the UI for review. Users can then export the data as CSV or PDF files, generated using Pandas and ReportLab. Visualization is handled with Chart.js, showing a breakdown of tag-based content, and sentiment analysis using TextBlob provides insights into the tone of the scraped data. The application runs locally on a Flask server, with HTML templates, CSS, and JavaScript providing an interactive, user-friendly interface.
